on reading around category theory. its interesting how its dumped upon a lot of frontend devs as this magic sauce, and to some extent i can appreciate as a descriptive theory of connectives. discussing this is difficult, but it should not be. category theory power and its luster that is appreciated in CS and in programing language research is the realization that in mathematics every mathematical system can be represented and explored as categories, and these categories have qualities to them that illuminate more structure.
